    <h3>First things first <small>what is Twilio?</small></h3>
    <p>
        Twilio is a platform that offers telecom services in a way that is easy for developers to integrate with applications. These services include SMS, Whatsapp, Voice calls, etc.
        What they <strong>don't</strong> offer is a simple interface for people who doesn't know coding to use their services. And that's where this tool comes in.
        This tools uses your Twilio account to send SMS messages from a simple spreadsheet file. This guide will take you all the way from setting up your Twilio account to delivering your first message. Let's get started!
    </p>
    

    <h3>Getting a Twilio account and credentials<small> go ahead, it's free and doesn't require a credit card</small></h3>
    <p>
        First thing you'll need to do is signup for a Twilio account. Head on over to <a href="https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio" target="_blank">Twilio's signup page</a>, fill the form and hit "Start your free trial". Once you finish setting up your account
        you'll be taken to your dashboard. This is where you'll get your <strong>Account SID</strong> and <strong>Token</strong>, which we'll use to send your messages. Check the following screenshot: the red boxes show you where these fields are on your dashboard.
        Notice that your Token won't be visible. Click on the button shown to display your password. Save both the Account SID and Token, as we'll use them shortly.

            As stated above, this site doesn't store your credentials in any way. But I wouldn't ask you to just take my word for it. That's why I recommend that you use a <strong>Token</strong>
            instead of your Twilio password. This might be a bit advanced for most of the users but if you have some understanding of API security, please follow <a href="https://www.twilio.com/docs/iam/access-tokens" target="_blank">this article</a> to create
            a token. You can just use a token on the "Password" field instead of your Twilio password.

    <!-- <ol>
        <li>The Twilio number that you'll be using to send your messages from</li>
        <li>The destination number</li>
        <li>The message itself</li>
    </ol>
    Add one row for each message you want to send, save the file and use the form at the end of this page to send your messages. That's it! Here's a detailed guide on how to generate the spreadsheet
